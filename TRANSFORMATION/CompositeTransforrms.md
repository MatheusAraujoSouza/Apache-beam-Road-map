## Composite transforms

In Apache Beam, transforms are the building blocks of data processing pipelines. They represent a single data processing operation, such as filtering, mapping, or aggregating data. In some cases, however, a single transform may not be enough to accomplish a complex data processing task. That's where composite transforms come in.

A composite transform is a transform that is composed of one or more simpler transforms. These simpler transforms can be other composite transforms or primitive transforms, such as ParDo, Combine, or GroupByKey. Composite transforms allow you to create more complex data processing pipelines by combining simpler operations into a single composite operation.


## Flatten:

```java
PCollection<String> pc1 = ... // some PCollection of strings
PCollection<String> pc2 = ... // another PCollection of strings
PCollection<String> result = PCollectionList.of(pc1).and(pc2).apply(Flatten.<String>pCollections());
```

In this example, we create two PCollections pc1 and pc2 containing strings, then we use the PCollectionList.of() method to create a list of these PCollections, and finally we apply the Flatten transform to the list to create a single PCollection result containing all the strings from pc1 and pc2.

## Composite ParDo:
```java
PCollection<Integer> input = ... // some PCollection of integers
TupleTag<Integer> tag1 = new TupleTag<Integer>() {};
TupleTag<Integer> tag2 = new TupleTag<Integer>() {};

// Create two ParDo transforms
PCollection<Integer> output1 = input.apply(ParDo.of(new FilterFn())).withOutputTags(tag1, TupleTagList.empty());
PCollection<Integer> output2 = input.apply(ParDo.of(new MapFn())).withOutputTags(tag2, TupleTagList.empty());

// Merge the outputs of the two ParDo transforms using a CoGroupByKey transform
PCollection<KV<Integer, CoGbkResult>> merged = KeyedPCollectionTuple.of(tag1, output1).and(tag2, output2).apply(CoGroupByKey.create());

// Use a third ParDo transform to process the merged output
PCollection<String> result = merged.apply(ParDo.of(new ProcessFn()));

```

In this example, we start with a PCollection input containing integers. We then create two ParDo transforms using the ParDo.of() method and assign them different output tags (tag1 and tag2). We use these output tags to merge the outputs of the two ParDo transforms using a CoGroupByKey transform. Finally, we apply a third ParDo transform to the merged output to produce a PCollection result containing strings.

These examples illustrate how composite transforms can be used to create more complex data processing pipelines by combining simpler operations into a single composite operation.
