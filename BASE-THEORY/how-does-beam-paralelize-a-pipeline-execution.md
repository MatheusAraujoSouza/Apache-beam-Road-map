# how does beam paralelize a pipeline execution ? 

Apache Beam can parallelize the execution of a pipeline by dividing the work into smaller units, known as "bundles," and distributing them across multiple workers. This allows the pipeline to be executed in parallel, which can improve the performance and scalability of the pipeline.

To parallelize the execution of a pipeline in Apache Beam, you can use one of the following approaches:




<li>Use a runner that supports parallel execution: Some runners, such as the DataflowRunner and the FlinkRunner, are designed to execute pipelines in parallel by default. When you run your pipeline with one of these runners, the work will be automatically divided into bundles and distributed across multiple workers.</li>
<li>Use the ParDo transform: The ParDo transform allows you to apply a user-defined function to each element of a PCollection in parallel. By using the ParDo transform, you can parallelize the processing of a PCollection by applying your function to each element in parallel.
<br>
In Apache Beam, ParDo is a transform that allows you to apply a user-defined function to each element of a PCollection in parallel. The ParDo transform is a key building block for constructing parallel pipelines in Apache Beam.
<br>
Here is an example of how you might use the ParDo transform in Java:
<br>
<br>



```Java
PCollection<String> words = ...;

PCollection<String> upperCaseWords = words.apply(ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, String>() {
  @ProcessElement
  public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
    c.output(c.element().toUpperCase());
  }
}));
```



</li>


<li>Use the Partition transform: The Partition transform allows you to divide a PCollection into a fixed number of partitions, which can then be processed in parallel.</li><br>

By using one of these approaches, you can parallelize the execution of your pipeline and improve its performance and scalability.
